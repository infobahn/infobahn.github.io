        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>Every agency, client and project is different, so there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. We focus on being flexible, and adjusting our methods to accommodate a variety of project management and production workflows.</p>

        <p>We work best when we partner with our clients long-term, so our model is designed to allow us to support you at every stage of a web project.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Sign up to our monthly support package so that you can always have us on call to advise and help out with web projects at any stage in the pipeline, through initial explorations, scoping and design, right through to front and back-end development and QA.</li>

            <li>Send us technical questions, RFPs that need scoping, UX designs requiring technical reviews - whatever you want.</li>

            <li>Rest assured that your website will be fine with 24/7 uptime monitoring, and bug fixes included. So good you’ll want it for your client’s websites too!</li>

            <li>When the time comes, benefit from a preferred rate on development work (10% discount).</li>
